                <p>Plot is the stuff that happens in your story, but it must make sense with your world’s theme, tone, and context. You can’t simply throw a tarrasque at everything because that would ignore the grander scale of things (and it would be a lazy TPK move).</p>
                <p> Is your story about romance and intrigue? Build up the theme, or overall point of the story, by throwing in competing suitors and family drama tied up in governance, like Romeo and Juliet. Or how about a fantasy epic to save the world through a road trip? Try setting the tone by using big fancy names for the elves, dwarves, and hobbits, and describe the stuff you visit in a big fancy way, like Lord of the Rings.</p>

                <p>Or what if you just want to force the players into a death battle to the…. death (real original, Nathanael), put it context! Get the party captured by gladiatorial raiders to be sacrificed to their deity of choice. Or have them be forced into the ring for the survival of their community (but be ready for shenanigans involving eventual governmental collapse, I see you Hunger Games!).</p>
                <p>Also, never forget to capitalize on player stupidity (ahem, creativity). Does the dragonborn accidentally set the palace aflame? Now the campaign revolves around NOT being killed by angry mobs of loyal citizens. Don’t be afraid to change things to suit the moment, some of the best stories are created spontaneously, after all.</p>
