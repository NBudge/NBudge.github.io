                <p>Characters are the lifeblood of DnD, they seed the world with its powers and drive its grand forces. A DnD game without characters is like a marble run without marbles; it just doesn’t work, and there are a few reasons why.</p>
                <p>Characters are the ones who destroy the One Ring, redeem Darth Vader, and discover Atlantis (and they go on and on about their epic backstories). They also conquer Hyrule, poison the fairest maidens, and tax the poor folk of Nottingham (and also go on and on about their epic backstories). Both the heroes and the villains need to be believable and compelling and are vital to the story (would you read a novel about a rock if no one found it?).</p>

                <p>Do your players want to save the world? Give them something they must save the world from. Alternatively, if the players simply want to kill everything in their path, try throwing more traditional “heroes” at them to give something better to fight against than defenseless villagers. Be flexible about what your players’ characters would need for a good enemy.</p>
                <p>Also, if your NPCs are so one-dimensional that they could pass for invisible from the side, try giving them epic hobbies or character traits or a neat mustache.</p>
