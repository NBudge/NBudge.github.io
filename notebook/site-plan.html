      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Have you ever wondered how writers can keep their worlds in check? Or how they can build amazing locations and events without losing the interest of their readers? I will give them a website to help them worldbuild and generate ideas and thoughts clearly and effectively. I will also use DnD as my main example of good worldbuilding</p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This website will help those who wish to create fantastic worlds and use them as they see fit. Its audience is primarily driven individuals of any age with large creative writing potential. This is so the site can help these people accomplish their goals, and because they will get the most benefit from it.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Worldbuilding</h3>
      <p>
        To create a fantasy world for DnD, you need to create a fantasy world. This can be done in two ways, depending on your personal ability and skill: outwards or inwards. Do you create a world and fill it with all sorts of villains, heroes, nations, landmarks, and locations first? That is an example of inwards worldbuilding, you set the scale of your artwork and then paint in finer and finer detail (but not too much or the paint will just dribble off the canvas and stain your reputation). Alternatively, you can focus solely on the exploits of your players and generate the world as you go, adding places, towns, cities, and NPCs as you go. This allows for great freedom in allowing PCs to do whatever they want but requires you to constantly be ready to create content on the fly. This means that when the party unintentionally summons Cthulhu, you’d best be ready to create stuff for him to mess around with. I like to use a balance of these two approaches, creating a world and filling it in as the game progresses, but hey, you do what feels most comfortable.

      </ul>
      <h3>Character Building</h3>
      <p>
        Characters are the lifeblood of DnD, they seed the world with its powers and drive its grand forces. A DnD game without characters is like a marble run without marbles; it just doesn’t work. Characters are the ones who destroy the One Ring, redeem Darth Vader, and discover Atlantis (and they go on and on about their epic backstories). They also conquer Hyrule, poison the fairest maidens, and tax the poor folk of Nottingham (and also go on and on about their epic backstories). Both the heroes and the villains need to be believable and compelling and are vital to the story (would you read a novel about a rock if no one found it?)  Do your players want to save the world? Give them something they must save the world from. Alternatively, if the players simply want to kill everything in their path, try throwing more traditional “heroes” at them to give something better to fight against than defenseless villagers. Be flexible about what your players’ characters would need for a good enemy. Also, if your characters are so one-dimensional that they could pass for invisible from the side, try giving them epic hobbies or character traits or a neat mustache.

      </ul>
      <h3>Plot Building</h3>
      <p>
        Plot is the stuff that happens in your story, but it must make sense with your world’s theme, tone, and context. You can’t simply throw a tarrasque at everything because that would ignore the grander scale of things (and it would be a lazy TPK move). Is your story about romance and intrigue? Build up the theme, or overall point of the story, by throwing in competing suitors and family drama tied up in governance, like Romeo and Juliet. Or how about a fantasy epic to save the world through a road trip? Try setting the tone by using big fancy names for the elves, dwarves, and hobbits, and describe the stuff you visit in a big fancy way, like Lord of the Rings. Or what if you just want to force the players into a death battle to the…. death (real original, Nathanael), put it context! Get the party captured by gladiatorial raiders to be sacrificed to their deity of choice. Or have them be forced into the ring for the survival of their community (but be ready for shenanigans involving eventual governmental collapse, I see you Hunger Games!). Also, never forget to capitalize on player stupidity (ahem, creativity). Does the dragonborn accidentally set the palace aflame? Now the campaign revolves around NOT being killed by angry mobs of loyal citizens. Don’t be afraid to change things to suit the moment, some of the best stories are created spontaneously, after all.
